# Fish Classification Model
Fish Classification AI model trained by using Tensorflow and Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). This model has the ability to predict the fish species for the given input image.

First of all, we need to train a model to detect fish from other animals

## 1.Fish Detection Model

Here we are going to train a binary classification model by using a pre-trained model **'MobileNet'**. Model have been trained by using **12000 Test Data and 68000 Training Data** for *two classes*, which is Fish vs Not-Fish



## 2.Fish Species Classification Model
We made our own custom model for the classification model and trained for *20 classes* using **6000 Test data and 34000 training dataset**.

## 3. Final Program
By combining both models we are able to predict if the input image has a fish or not, if yes then what is the name of the fish species
